As user:  
This system helps in making pairing names. At first, the student's names are added by press on "add student" in the nav par. Then in each sprint the user can write the sprint name and the new pairing names will appear by click on "create". The user can change the list until reaching the best list then click "submit" to send the data to the database and save it.
